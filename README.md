# Student Performance Prediction

This project aims to predict the final grades of students based on various factors such as demographics, study habits, and past performance. The dataset used is `student-por.csv`, which contains information on Portuguese students.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the final grade (`G3`) of students using a Linear Regression model. The model takes various features such as `age`, `studytime`, `absences`, and past grades (`G1`, `G2`) to make the prediction.

## Dataset
The dataset `student-por.csv` includes the following columns:
- `school`: The school the student attends
- `sex`: The gender of the student
- `age`: The age of the student
- `address`, `famsize`, `Pstatus`, `Medu`, `Fedu`, `Mjob`, `Fjob`, `reason`, `guardian`
- `traveltime`: The travel time to school
- `studytime`: The amount of study time per week
- `failures`: The number of past class failures
- `schoolsup`, `famsup`, `paid`, `activities`, `nursery`
- `higher`: Whether the student plans to take higher education
- `internet`: Whether the student has internet access at home
- `romantic`: Romantic relationship status
- `famrel`, `freetime`, `goout`, `Dalc`, `Walc`, `health`
- `absences`: The number of school absences
- `G1`: The first period grade
- `G2`: The second period grade
- `G3`: The final grade

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-performance-prediction.git
   cd student-performance-prediction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Ensure you have the dataset:
   Make sure `student-por.csv` is in the project directory.

## Usage
1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Start Jupyter Notebook by running:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open the notebook file (e.g., `student_performance_prediction.ipynb`).

2. **Run the Notebook**:
   Follow the instructions within the notebook to:
   - Load and clean the dataset
   - Train the model (if not already trained)
   - Make predictions based on new inputs
   - Visualize the data

## Visualizations
The project includes visualizations to explore the relationship between absences and final grades:
- Scatter Plot: Shows individual data points for absences vs. final grades.
- Box Plot: Displays the distribution of final grades for different ranges of absences.

## Model
The model used in this project is a Linear Regression model. It was trained using the following features:
- `age`, `traveltime`, `studytime`, `failures`, `freetime`, `goout`, `Walc`, `health`, `absences`, `G1`, `G2`, and encoded values for `school`, `sex`, `higher`, `internet`.

The trained model is saved as `student_linear_regression.joblib`.

## Results
The performance of the model is evaluated using the R-squared (RÂ²) metric.
