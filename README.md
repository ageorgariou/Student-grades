# Student Performance Prediction

This project aims to predict the final grades of students based on various factors such as demographics, study habits, and past performance. The dataset used is `student-por.csv`, which contains information on Portuguese students.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the final grade (`G3`) of students using a Linear Regression model. The model takes various features such as `age`, `studytime`, `absences`, and past grades (`G1`, `G2`) to make the prediction.

## Dataset
The dataset `student-por.csv` includes the following columns:

- `school`, `sex`, `age`, `address`, `famsize`, `Pstatus`, `Medu`, `Fedu`, `Mjob`, `Fjob`, `reason`, `guardian`, `traveltime`, `studytime`, `failures`, `schoolsup`, `famsup`, `paid`, `activities`, `nursery`, `higher`, `internet`, `romantic`, `famrel`, `freetime`, `goout`, `Dalc`, `Walc`, `health`, `absences`, `G1`, `G2`, `G3`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-performance-prediction.git
   cd student-performance-prediction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Ensure you have the dataset `student-por.csv` in the project directory.

## Usage
1. **Training the Model**:
   If you need to train the model, you can use the provided script (if not already trained):
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

2. **Making Predictions**:
   Run the prediction script to input new student data and get a grade prediction:
   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```

   The script will prompt you for various inputs and provide a predicted final grade (`G3`).

## Visualizations
The project includes visualizations to explore the relationship between absences and final grades:

- **Scatter Plot**: Shows individual data points for absences vs. final grades.
- **Box Plot**: Displays the distribution of final grades for different ranges of absences.

To generate these visualizations, run:
```bash
python visualize.py
```

## Model
The model used in this project is a Linear Regression model. It was trained using the following features:
- `age`, `traveltime`, `studytime`, `failures`, `freetime`, `goout`, `Walc`, `health`, `absences`, `G1`, `G2`, and encoded values for `school`, `sex`, `higher`, `internet`.

The trained model is saved as `student_linear_regression.joblib`.

## Results
The performance of the model is evaluated using the R-squared (RÂ²) metric.
